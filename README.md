Android Wear Temperature Converter
 This assignment will help students get familiar with building simple, interactive Android Wear applications. The app 
should allow users to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius through a basic UI on a Wear OS device. You are 
tasked to implement a user interface that uses the UI elements outlined in this document, for developing an Android wear 
application for a temperature converter. When a user enters a temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius and taps the 
corresponding button, the app should calculate and display the converted temperature in the other unit.
